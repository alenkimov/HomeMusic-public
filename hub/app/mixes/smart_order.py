"""The pure rules of the smart shuffle (MIXES.md 8): the order of the playlist's own songs and where the
recommendations go. No database, no network — everything here is a function of its arguments.

- «Fewer repeats» (Spotify's engineering blog, 2025): several random orders are made, each is given a staleness
  (a penalty for songs the user heard lately: the later the song was heard and the earlier it stands, the larger),
  the freshest one is taken. Songs of one artist are spread out first (the idea Spotify had in 2014), so that they
  do not follow one another.
- One recommendation after every `own_per_rec(n)` own songs: 3 in a playlist of more than 15 songs (Spotify's
  figure), 2 in a shorter one (ours; Spotify gives no figure); a playlist of one or two songs gets one.
