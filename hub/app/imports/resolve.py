"""Matching an import's rows against the library and the catalog, the way the assistant does it (`match_catalog`,
duration ±3 s, the album as a hint), but quietly and in batches.

Verdicts: `owned` — in the library already; `exact` — a confident catalog match (goes to work without asking);
`probable` — a weaker one (goes to work too, but the report lists it); `not_found` — waits for the user.
What a service id turned out to be is kept in `source_map` for every user: a second import of the same
songs barely searches. The library is checked every time (it changes), the catalog once.
